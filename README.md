# Neuroanatomy_Passthrough_Quest2
 This is an improved implementation of Chris Larkee's open source Neuroanatomy VR project in Quest 2 Mixed Reality Passthrough. For this solution I updated the project to a version of Unity compatible with mixed reality passthrough, manually added the necessary components for passthrough functionality and removed the virtual backgrounds from the scenes.
